# Arsenal-App


This is an Android application that will provide basic information about Arsenal's upcoming fixtures. 

## To-Do

* Design the database: Information to include, type of data etc.
* Implement the access to the database to the app.
* Web scraper / API to retrieve information (Likely a python script - Either run daily using scheduler or host and connect with app)


## Future Plans

* Additional information about recent and future fixtures - This could be clickable into a fragment containing more stats.
* Involving a search option to find the information for any premier league team.
