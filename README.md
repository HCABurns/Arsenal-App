# General-Personal-App

This is an Android application that will provide information about a variety of topics congregated in a single app. This is a personal project to create an application that will allow me to further my knowledge in Java as well as have a bespoke app.

## Currently Implemented:

* Countdown to Arsenal F.C's next fixture with extra information.
* Recycler view of Arsenal F.C's next few fixtures with extra information.
* Information regarding the upcoming free games on epicgames.com
* F1 Page to display the next F1 circuit, qualifying and sprint/race times. (22/6/25)
* Full database access via an API requiring user authentication. (22/6/25 - 23/6/25)

## Planned Implementation:

* Change from loadingBar to skeleton loaders with appropriate connection / error messages.
* Redesign the epic game menu to be a single game with a swipe to view another game.
* Potential for an upcoming F1 race page (Potential alter: Convert the F1 Page to include swiping for the next event).
* Weather Information - Specificially the wind information.
* Aggregation of the top stories from multiple news sources.
* Expand on the readme/docs.

## Possible Future Implementation:

* Clickable Future Matches - Include clickable items that include extra information regarding a game: recent results etc.
* Potentially change the navigation page from the bottom to a hamburger menu.
* Add other football teams and allow for searching of fixtures - Using a user preference of their team to be displayed first.
