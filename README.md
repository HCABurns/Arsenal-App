# Arsenal-App

This is an Android application that will provide basic information about Arsenal's upcoming fixtures. This is a personal project to create an application that will allow me to further my knowledge in Java.


## To Do:

* Clean the code as it currently is: Ensure all comments are understandable and relevant, all functions have a javadoc, any todos are marked with clear information.
* Redesign the homepage to: Include a countdown, be the proper format, wrap for different screens.
* Screen 2 - Include smaller items that include all the next few games and their information.
* Decide how the web-scraper will interact with the app. (Host and call with API or schedule and run daily.)
* Expand on the readme - Async with Firebase.



## Future Plans

* Additional information about recent and future fixtures - This could be clickable into a fragment containing more stats.
* Involving a search option to find the information for any premier league team.
